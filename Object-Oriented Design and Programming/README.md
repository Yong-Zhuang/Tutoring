# Object-Oriented Design and Programming

This repository contains course materials for the "Object-Oriented Design and Programming" course.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and design concepts. The course covers the following topics:

- Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
- Design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral)
- Testing and debugging object-oriented code

## Course Materials

The course materials include lecture notes, assignments, and code examples. The lecture notes cover the main topics of the course and provide in-depth explanations of the key concepts. The assignments are designed to give students hands-on experience with object-oriented programming and design principles. The code examples demonstrate how to implement various design patterns and best practices in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course materials, simply clone this repository to your local machine. The code examples are organized by topic, and the assignments are organized by week. The lecture notes are provided in PDF format.
